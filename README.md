## Demo

See a demo of the application at the following link: [AzureImageGallery](https://azureimagegallery.azurewebsites.net/)

## Scope

This is a full stack application using C#/ASP.Net Core as an image gallery that uploads and reads files to an Azure blob storage container. Images have full create, edit, and delete functionality.

A SQL database reads an Uri to the actual file in the container of the storage service and serves it via web view, thus reducing space (and cost) needed in a relational database.

## Project Structure

Azure-Image-Gallery is an N-tier project that contains three major project layers:

- The MVC web application contained in `AzureImageGallery.Web`.
- Database configuration, interfaces, and entities in the `AzureImageGallery.Data`.
- The business logic services layer to complete operations in the `AzureImageGallery.Services` directory.  

## Features

- Upload images or files and view them by date created.
- Search by title of an image.
- Paging.
- Authentication with Login/Register.

## Setup and Download

In order to use this application:

- Download a zip file or clone the repository.

```bash
~$ git clone https://github.com/pcshrosbree/azure-image-gallery
```

- Then, gather any missing NuGet packages and restore the project files using the DotNet command `dotnet restore` (or Build in Visual Studio).

- Afterwards, you will need to have an Azure account that has a Blob Storage service. Get the connection string from the account info under Access Keys, then pass them in the User Secrets or Application settings JSON file as:
`{ "AzureStorageConnectionString": "YourActualKey" }`.

- Make sure you use either Visual Studio Secret Manager or the `dotnet` command line to add the above JSON object (from point #3.) so the CloudStorage class and methods can connect using that string.

- Upon initial startup of the application, if it is currently in development mode, a Sqlite database will be created and a few images will be seeded into the database for testing purposes.

## Configuration

The secrets JSON file should have the form:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "AzureStorageConnectionString": "<connection string>"
  }
}
```

### **appsettings.json sections**

- ConnectionStrings
   - `Sqlite` specifies the Sqlite connection string
- StorageTransferOptions
   - Specifies transfer options for Azure storage BLOBs as defined in the [StorageTransferOptions Struct](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.storage.storagetransferoptions?view=azure-dotnet)
- Throttling
   - `Rate` specifies the percentage of PUT requests to throttle
- RetryPolicy
   - Specifies retry policy for Azure as defined in the [RetryOptions Class](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.core.retryoptions?view=azure-dotnet)

### Environment variables

If the `AZURE_SDK_TRANSPORT` environment variable is set to `false` then the Azure SDK HttpClientTransport is set to the fault injection transport.
